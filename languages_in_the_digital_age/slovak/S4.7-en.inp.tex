The current state of LT support varies considerably from one language community to another. In order to compare the situation between languages, this section will present an evaluation based on two sample application areas (machine translation and speech processing) and one underlying technology (text analysis), as well as basis resources needed for building LT applications. The languages were categorised using the following five-point scale:

\input{Table-cluster-en.inp}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Cluster 1 (excellent LT support)
  \item Cluster 2 (good support)
  \item Cluster 3 (moderate support)
  \item Cluster 4 (fragmentary support) 
  \item Cluster 5 (weak or no support)
\end{itemize}

LT support was measured according to the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Speech Processing: Quality of existing speech recognition technologies, quality of existing speech synthesis technologies, coverage of domains, number and size of existing speech corpora, amount and variety of available speech-based applications
\item Machine Translation: Quality of existing MT technologies, number of language pairs covered, coverage of linguistic phenomena and domains, quality and size of existing parallel corpora, amount and variety of available MT applications
\item Text Analysis: Quality and coverage of existing text analysis technologies (morphology, syntax, semantics), coverage of linguistic phenomena and domains, amount and variety of available applications, quality and size of existing (annotated) text corpora, quality and coverage of existing lexical resources (e.g., WordNet) and grammars
\item Resources: Quality and size of existing text corpora, speech corpora and parallel corpora, quality and coverage of existing lexical resources and grammars
\end{itemize}
