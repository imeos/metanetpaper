The Slovak Terminology Database
\footnote{\url{http://data.juls.savba.sk/std/}} includes Slovak terms
and relevant terminological information from various disciplines. The
database serves for the stabilizing and unification of terminological
systems, through the cooperation of linguists and experts from relevant
professional fields. Its aim is to summarize and standardize the Slovak 
terminology. The terms are obtained from the specialized professional
corpora (corpus of law texts, economy texts, etc.).
