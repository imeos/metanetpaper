Drawing on the insights gained so far, it appears that today’s 'hybrid' language technology mixing deep processing with statistical methods will be able to bridge the gap between all European languages and beyond. As this series of white papers shows, there is a dramatic difference in the state of readiness with respect to language solutions and the state of research between Europe’s member states. 

META-NET’s long-term goal is to introduce high-quality language technology for all languages in order to achieve political and economic unity through cultural diversity. The technology will help tear down existing barriers and build bridges between Europe’s languages. This requires all stakeholders - in politics, research, business, and society - to unite their efforts for the future.

This whitepaper series complements other strategic actions taken by META-NET (see the appendix for an overview). Up-to-date information such as the current version of the META-NET vision paper\footnote{\url{http://www.meta-net.eu/vision/reports/meta-net-vision-paper.pdf}} or the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) can be found on the META-NET web site: \url{http://www.meta-net.eu}.
