The database of the Spoken Corpus of
Slovak\footnote{\url{http://data.juls.savba.sk/oral/}} contains audio records
of spontaneous and semi-prepared speech from the entire Slovak territory and
their text transcripts. Specific characteristics of spoken language are
selectively captured in the transcripts, such as irregular structure of an
utterance, pronunciation variants, means of speech modulation, and presence of
the non-linguistic elements. The Spoken Corpus of Slovak provides material for
research and description of the real form of contemporary standard spoken
Slovak.
