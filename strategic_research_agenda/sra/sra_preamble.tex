  In everyday communication, Europe’s citizens, business
  partners and politicians are inevitably confronted with language
  barriers. Language technology has the potential to overcome these
  barriers and to provide innovative interfaces to technologies and
  knowledge. This document presents a Strategic Research Agenda for
  Multilingual Europe 2020.

  The paper was prepared by META-NET, a Network of Excellence
  funded by the European Commission. META-NET consists of 60 research
  centres in 34 countries, who cooperate with stakeholders from
  economy, government agencies, research organisations,
  non-governmental organisations, language communities and European
  universities. META-NET’s vision is high-quality language technology
  for all European languages.\\\\

  ``The research carried out in the area of language technology is of
  utmost importance for the consolidation of Portuguese as a language
  of global communication in the information society.''\\
  \textcolor{grey2}{--- Dr.~Pedro Passos Coelho (Prime-Minister of
  Portugal)}\\[2mm]
  %
  ``It is imperative that language technologies for Slovene are
  developed systematically if we want Slovene to flourish also in the
  future digital world.''\\
  \textcolor{grey2}{--- Dr. Danilo Türk (President of the Republic of
  Slovenia)}\\[2mm]
  %
  ``For such small languages like Latvian keeping up with the ever
  increasing pace of time and technological development is
  crucial. The only way to ensure future existence of our language is
  to provide its users with equal opportunities as the users of larger
  languages enjoy. Therefore being on the forefront of modern
  technologies is our opportunity.''\\ \textcolor{grey2}{--- Valdis
  Dombrovskis (Prime Minister of Latvia)}\\[2mm]
  %
  ``Europe's inherent multilingualism and our scientific expertise are
  the perfect prerequisites for significantly advancing the challenge
  that language technology poses. META-NET opens up new opportunities
  for the development of ubiquitous multilingual technologies.''\\
  \textcolor{grey2}{--- Prof. Dr. Annette Schavan (German Minister of
  Education and Research)} }

  Language technologies include: spelling and grammar checkers; web search; voice dialing; interactive dialogue systems (e.\,g., phone banking or train reservation systems); interactive assistants such as Apple's Siri or Google's voice search; crosslingual search in digital libraries (e.\,g., Europeana); term extraction; speech synthesis for navigation systems; recommender systems for online shops; automatic content summarisation; and machine translation systems such as Google Translate and Microsoft's Bing Translator.

  \rowcolor{orange2}\vspace{.10cm}\centerline{{\textcolor{white}{\Large\textbf{What is Language Technology?}}}}\\[-2mm]
  \rowcolor{orange2} Language technologies are technologies for automatically analysing and generating the most complex information medium in our world, \emph{human language}, in both its spoken and written forms (as well as sign language). These technologies are developed by experts involved in linguistics, computer science, computational linguistics and related disciplines \cite{jurafsky-martin01,manning-schuetze1,lt-world1,lt-survey1}.
